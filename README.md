# Advent of Code in Rust
Advent of Code Solutions written in Rust with emphasis on performance aspects.

## Puzzle data files
As of the Advent of Code rules, the puzzle inputs are not part of this repository.

Under each year a /res folder needs to be presents and the filename should be 
in the format 'input_day_01.txt'. 
Otherwise please change the const values in the lib.rs files.
