# Advent of Code 2023 Day 2
Here two different solutions are presented to show the impact of the algorithm on the runtime.
The fast versions avoid any string operation and use the bytes of the string only. This is 
10 times faster.

part1_str:  0.117 ms  
part1_fast: 0.010 ms 

part2_str:  0.170 ms  
part2_fast: 0.014 ms
