# Advent of Code 2023 Day 4
Here a number of different solutions are presented to show the impact of the algorithm on the runtime.

As usual, parsing with str is most expensive, vec and arr parse with u8. Array makes it even faster.

part1_str:   0.177 ms  
part1_vec:   0.080 ms  
part1_array: 0.054 ms

part2_vec:   0.077 ms
